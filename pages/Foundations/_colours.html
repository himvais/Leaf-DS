    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>ERM products use a wide range of colours and our colour palette is creating keeping these needs in mind.</p>
    <p>All the colours can be devided into two broad categories: Brand colours and UI Colours.</p>
    <h5>Brand Colours</h5>
    <p>Each ERM product has it's own dedicated colour, this colour functions as primary identifier for the product's brand.</p>
    <p>Generally, a single solid colour is used for representing the product brand and is aligned with the product logo etc. We use this primary colour to create a palette of additional colours calculated using brand colours to support product branding. All the major foundation classes actually use this brand driven colours to apply effects like text colours and backgrounds.</p>
    <h5>UI Colours</h5>
